# R4ME3101T-Computational-fluid-dynamics
This repository is a part of the course offered by the mechanical department of VJTI. 

There will be algorithms added as learned in the course throughout the semester. 

## CFD 
It is a way to model the fluid's momentum, temperature, pressure, and basically any property, such that it is computationally efficient and gives an algebraic solution that converges.
